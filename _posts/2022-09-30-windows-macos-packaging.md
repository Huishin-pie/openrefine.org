OpenRefine's packaging for MacOS and Windows could be improved in many ways, and we are looking for help in this front.
We are looking for proposals from prospective contractors to improve the install experience of OpenRefine on MacOS and/or Windows.
After a similar effort on Ubuntu/Debian packaging, this initiative is meant to improve the user experience on other platforms, to lower the install barrier for a broader audience.
This project is funded by an [EOSS Diversity and Inclusion grant](https://cziscience.medium.com/advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-scientific-open-source-eaabe6a5488b) from [CZI](https://chanzuckerberg.com/).

We are hoping that those proposals could solve some of the following issues:
* (MacOS) [Provide an Applications shortcut in the DMG distribution, with a suitable background (#5205)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/5205)
* (MacOS) [Sign and notarize our DMG distribution (#2191)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2191)
* (Windows) [Offer a proper installer / uninstaller on Windows (#3224)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3224)
* (Windows) [Give an easier way to start and stop OpenRefine with a system tray integration and log viewer (#3221)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3221)
* (Windows) [Configuration for OpenRefine on Windows should use only 1 config file (.ini) (#3057)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3057)
* (Windows) [Sign openrefine.exe to eliminate extra security warnings (#3003)](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/3003)

All new packaging steps should be integrated in our Continuous Deployment infrastructure (currently running on GitHub Actions), if not in our Maven packaging configuration itself.

We have funding to contract out this work to freelancers.
To respond to this opportunity, please send the following to our developers mailing list (openrefine-dev@googlegroups.com):
* a short description of the changes you propose to introduce and how they relate to the issues above
* your price for this work
* any pointers to some related work in other projects (or anything that can help us assess your ability to carry out the proposed work)

Proposals will be reviewed by our [project director and advisory committee](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md). Feel free to get in touch with us if you have any questions about this call.
