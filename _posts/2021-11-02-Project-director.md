**OpenRefine is seeking a *Part-time Project Director* (paid position).**

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a power tool to clean messy data, popular in a diverse range of communities. It has been serving the needs of journalists, librarians, Wikipedians, scientists for more than 10 years, and is taught in many curricula and workshops around the world.

The OpenRefine team is seeking a project director to help the project grow its operations and community.
This position is:
* fully remote: you will be working with a team spread on multiple continents;
* part-time: the position can accommodate with other commitments;
* contractor or employee: depending on the director's situation, we are able to accommodate with both options. An Employer of Record would be used if the director is based outside of the USA.
* initially for 2 years, to start as soon as possible. The expectation is that the position could continue via funding from other sources.

Initial funding for the position is available for two years, funded by a grant from the [Silicon Valley Community Foundation](https://www.siliconvalleycf.org/) via the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) under their [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/) programme, specifically focusing on improving Diversity and Inclusion in open source projects.
