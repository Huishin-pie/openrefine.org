**OpenRefine is seeking a new member for its Advisory Committee (unpaid position).**

[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a powerful tool to clean messy data, popular in a diverse range of communities. It has been serving the needs of journalists, librarians, Wikipedians, scientists for more than ten years and is taught in many curricula and workshops around the world. OpenRefine received a two years grant from the [Silicon Valley Community Foundation](https://www.siliconvalleycf.org/) via the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) under their [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/) program, specifically focusing on improving Diversity and Inclusion in open source projects. OpenRefine is a fiscally sponsored project of [Code for Science & Society Inc](https://codeforscience.org/), a 501\(c\)(3) charitable organization in the USA.

Within OpenRefine, the Advisory Committee is a small group of committed community members who oversee the project and coordinate with Code for Science & Society for its operations. So far, the advisory committee has had most of the executive
responsabilities within the project, but we are looking into hiring a project director who would play this executive role on behalf of the advisory committee (see [the corresponding job posting for
details](https://openrefine.org/blog/2021/11/05/Project-director.html)).

The advisory committee currently consists of Martin Magdinier and Antonin Delpeuch.

## About the position

This position is for you if you:
* care deeply about the future of OpenRefine;
* have good communication skills in English;
* are able to join a monthly call with Code for Science and Society where we coordinate the project's operations.

## How to respond

Please nominate yourself or other members of the community with [this form]().
The current advisory committee will engage a conversation with the nominees and select one or more new members.
