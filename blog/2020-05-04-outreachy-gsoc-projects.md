We are happy to announce that three interns will join the development team this summer:
<!--truncate-->
* Lisa Chandra ([@lisa761](https://github.com/lisa761)), Google Summer of Code intern, will improve our grid view by adding support for infinite scrolling (displaying the entire grid without the need to browse it by small pages). She is supervised by
  Owen Stephens and Antonin Delpeuch.

* Lu Liu ([@afkbrb](https://github.com/afkbrb)), Google Summer of Code intern, will add support for OAuth and other Wikibase instances in the Wikidata extension. He will be supervised by Tom Morris and Antonin Delpeuch.

* Ekta Mishra ([@darecoder1999](https://github.com/darecoder1999)), our Outreachy intern, will work on improving the quality assurance features of the Wikidata integration, by adding support for new Wikidata constraints and improving the existing
  functionality. She will be supervised by Antonin Delpeuch.

We are very excited to welcome them to the team and are looking forward to working with them. The Google Summer of Code internships will run from June 1 to August 24 and the Outreachy internship from May 19 to August 18.

We thank all applicants for the quality of their proposals and their contributions to the project earlier this year.
