We are pleased to announce that the [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page) community has awarded a [WikidataCon 2019 Award](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:OpenRefine_WikidataCon_Award_winner.jpg) to OpenRefine in the <emph>Editing</emph> category.
<!--truncate-->
[Wikidata editing with OpenRefine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Tools/OpenRefine/Editing) was introduced in version 3.0, released in September 2018. It was used since to perform millions of Wikidata edits, either [directly from OpenRefine](https://tools.wmflabs.org/editgroups/?tool=OR) or via [QuickStatements](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements).

This award goes to all our users who do the hard work behind these imports, the mentors who organize workshops around the tool or write training material around it, the developers and translators, and the [Google News Initiative](https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/) which funded this feature.

For a 10 minutes introduction to Wikidata editing with OpenRefine, we recommend this video tutorial by Emma Carroll (who deserves special thanks for its clarity):
