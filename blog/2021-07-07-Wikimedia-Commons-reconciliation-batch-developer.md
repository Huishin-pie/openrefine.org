*Update (2021-08-06): both positions have been filled.*

**OpenRefine is seeking a *Junior Developer - Wikimedia Commons reconciliation and batch upload functionalities* (paid contractor position).**
<!--truncate-->
*[OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org/) is a power tool to clean messy data, popular in a diverse range of communities. It has been serving the needs of journalists, librarians, Wikipedians, scientists for more than 10 years, and is taught in many curricula and workshops around the world.* 

*OpenRefine is quite actively used on [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org), the structured data ‘sister’ of Wikipedia. In addition, thanks to a [grant from the Wikimedia Foundation](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:Project/Structured_Data_on_Wikimedia_Commons_functionalities_in_OpenRefine), OpenRefine will, between September 2021 and August 2022, be extended with structured data functionalities for [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data), the media repository of the Wikimedia ecosystem. This code extension will make it possible to batch edit structured data of existing files on Wikimedia Commons, and to batch upload new Wikimedia Commons files with structured data from the start.*

*OpenRefine is a fiscally sponsored project of [Code for Science & Society Inc](https://codeforscience.org/), a 501(c)(3) charitable organization in the US.*

The OpenRefine team is seeking a junior developer who will build the Wikimedia-specific features, as web services hosted on [Wikimedia Toolforge](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Toolforge) or [Wikimedia Cloud VPS](https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Portal:Cloud_VPS) for the abovementioned functionalities. 

* This is a part time contract, over a period of 6 months.
* Active work will be around 20 weeks, roughly from September 2021 until end February 2022.
* For an average of 20 hours per week.
* Fully remote. We encourage developers from outside of the USA and EU to apply.
* We have between 14,000 USD and 16,000 USD available to complete this assignment, depending on experience. The payment details will be negotiated with the contractor, who will invoice Code for Science & Society for their work towards the corresponding goals.

## Responsibilities

The Junior Developer:

* Develops a new OpenRefine reconciliation service specifically for Wikimedia Commons, inspired by the existing [Wikidata Reconciliation Service](https://wikidata.reconci.link/) and following the [Reconciliation Service API Protocol](https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/).
* Develops a batch upload tool for [structured data on Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data). Depending on circumstances, this batch upload functionality will be developed to be compatible with already existing upload tools in the Wikimedia ecosystem, such as [QuickStatements](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Help:QuickStatements), or as a new tool.
* Works in close collaboration with their colleague (OpenRefine developer), and will regularly coordinate with the product manager and the rest of the OpenRefine development team.
