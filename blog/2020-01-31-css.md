As announced in the previous post, the OpenRefine project has joined [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org/) as a Sponsored Project.
We are thrilled to join this new home, which will help the project grow on the long term and set its openness in stone.

This is the occasion for us to improve our gouvernance model, with the creation of two committees.
The advisory committee runs the project on a day to day basis and is composed of Martin Magdinier, Thad Guidry and Antonin Delpeuch.
The steering committee oversees the general direction of the project and initates links with other organizations and projects. We
are proud of our all-star line up for this steering committee, in alphabetical order:
