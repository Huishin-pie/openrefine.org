This year, OpenRefine is very happy to participate in [Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) again, an internship program in open source and open science initiated and run by the [Software Freedom Conservancy](https://www.sfconservancy.org/). 
<!--truncate-->
Outreachy provides paid, remote internships to people subject to systemic bias and impacted by underrepresentation in the technical industry where they are living. For OpenRefine, this is our second time welcoming and mentoring interns who actively improve our codebase and, while doing so, gain experience in open source development.

Our current participation in Outreachy is part of the project [OpenRefine for Everyone](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/openrefine-for-everyone/), which focuses on making OpenRefine more useful for international, multilingual audiences, by removing cultural biases from the tool. This project has been generously funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ([Diversity & Inclusion funding cycle](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/?cycle=d-i)).

From [end May until end August 2022](https://www.outreachy.org/alums/2022-05/), we warmly welcome [Elroy Kanye](https://github.com/elroykanye) (from Bamenda, Cameroon) and [Walton Goga](https://github.com/WaltonG) (from Nairobi, Kenya) to our team. Elroy works on the implementation of [server-side localization](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/2443) in OpenRefine, and is mentored by [Antonin Delpeuch](https://github.com/Antonin Delpeuch). Walton [develops a SPARQL importer](https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/issues/1212), with mentorship from [Antoine Beaubien](https://github.com/antoine2711). Please join us in welcoming them, and donâ€™t hesitate to thank them for their contributions as you see them appear in our repositories!
